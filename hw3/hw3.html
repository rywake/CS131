<h1>Homework 3. Java shared memory performance races</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>You're working for a startup company Ginormous Data Inc. (GDI) that
specializes in finding patterns in large amounts of data. For example,
a big retailer might give GDI all the web visits and purchases made
and all the credit reports they've inspected and records of all the
phone calls to them, and GDI will then find patterns in the data that
suggest which toys will be hot this Christmas season. The programs
that GDI writes are mostly written in Java. They aren't perfect;
they're just heuristics, and they're operating on incomplete and
sometimes-inaccurate information. They do need to be fast, though, as
your clients are trying to find patterns faster than their competition
can, and are willing to put up with a few errors even if the results
aren't perfect, so long as they get good-enough results quickly.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p> GDI regularly uses multithreading to speed up its applications,
and many of GDI's programs operate on shared-memory representations of
the state of a simulation. These states are updated safely, using
Java's <samp><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/syncmeth.html'>synchronized</a></samp>
keyword, and this is known to be a bottleneck in the code. Your boss
asks you what will happen if you remove the <samp>synchronized</samp>
keyword. You reply, "It'll break the simulations." She responds, "So
what? If it's just a small amount of breakage, that might be good
enough.  Or maybe you can substitute some other synchronization
strategy that's less heavyweight, and <em>that</em>'ll be good
enough." She suggests that you look into this by measuring how often
GDI's programs are likely to break if they switch to
inadequate-but-faster synchronization methods, and also by
looking into a safe technique that is faster than <samp>synchronized</samp>.</p>

<p>In some sense the first part of this assignment is the reverse of what
software engineers traditionally do with multithreaded
applications. Traditionally, they are worried about race conditions
and insert enough synchronization so that the races become
impossible. Here, though, you're deliberately trying to add races to
the code in order to speed it up, and want to measure whether (and
ideally, how badly) things will break if you do.</p>

<p>It should be noted that we are on thin ice here, so thin that some
would argue we've gone over the edge. That's OK: we're experimenting!

<h2>The Java memory model</h2>

<p>Java synchronization is based on
the <a href='https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/'>Java
memory model</a> (JMM), which defines how an application can safely
avoid data races when accessing shared memory. The JMM lets Java
implementations optimize accesses by allowing more behaviors than the
intuitive semantics where there is a global clock and actions by
threads interleave in a schedule that assumes sequential
consistency. On modern hardware, these intuitive semantics are often
incorrect: for example, intraprocessor cache communication might be
faster than memory, which means that a cached read can return a new
value on one processor before an uncached read returns an old value on
another. To allow this kind of optimization, first, the JMM says that
two accesses to the same location <dfn>conflict</dfn> if they come
from different threads, at least one is a write, and the location is
not declared to be <samp><a
href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/atomic.html'>volatile</a></samp>;
and second, the JMM says that behavior is well-defined to be data-race
free (DRF) unless two conflicting accesses occur without
synchronization in between.</p>

<p>The details for proving that a program is DRF can be tricky, as is
optimizing a Java implementation with data-race freedom in mind. Not
only have serious memory-synchronization bugs been found in Java
implementations, occasionally bugs have been found in the JMM itself,
and sometimes people have even announced bugs only to find out later
that they weren't bugs after all. For more details about this, please

<h2>How to break sequential consistency in Java</h2>

<p>It's easy to write programs that break sequential consistency in Java.
To model
this, you will use a simple prototype that manages a data structure
that represents an array of <samp>long</samp>s. Each array entry
starts at zero. A
state transition, called a <dfn>swap</dfn>, consists of subtracting 1
from one of the entries, and adding 1 to an entry &ndash; typically
a different entry although the two entries can be the same in which
case a swap does nothing.
The sum of all the array entries
should therefore
remain zero; if it becomes nonzero, that indicates that one or more
transitions weren't done correctly. The converse is not true: if the sum
is zero it's still possible
that some state transitions were done incorrectly. Still, this test
is a reasonable way to check for errors in the simulation.</p>

<p>For an example of a simulation, see <a href='jmm.jar'
type='application/java-archive'>jmm.jar</a>,
a <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/basicsindex.html'>JAR
file</a> containing the simplified source code of a simulation. It
contains the following interfaces and classes:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><samp>State</samp></dt>
 <dd>The API for a simulation state. The only way to change the state
   is to invoke <samp>swap(i,j)</samp>, where <samp>i</samp>
   and <samp>j</samp> are indexes into the array.
   This subtracts 1 from the <samp>i</samp>th entry and adds 1 to
   the <samp>j</samp>th entry.</dd>

 <dt><samp>NullState</samp></dt>
 <dd>An implementation of <samp>State</samp> that does nothing.
   Swapping has no effect. This is used for timing the scaffolding
   of the simulation.</dd>

 <dt><samp>SynchronizedState</samp></dt>
 <dd>An implementation of <samp>State</samp> that uses the
   <samp>Synchronized</samp> class so that it is safe but slow.</dd>

 <dt><samp>SwapTest</samp></dt>
 <dd>A
   <samp><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runnable.html'>Runnable</a></samp>
   class that tests a state implementation by performing
   a given number of swap transitions on it.</dd>

 <dt><samp>UnsafeMemory</samp></dt>
 <dd>A test harness, with a <samp>main</samp> method. Invoke it via a
   shell command like this:

   <pre><samp>time timeout 3600 java UnsafeMemory Synchronized 8 100000000 5</samp></pre>
   Here, the initial <samp>time</samp> tells the shell to give top-level real,
   user and system time.
   The <samp>timeout 3600</samp> puts a 3600-second timeout on Java,
   helpful if your program mistakenly loops forever.
   <samp>Synchronized</samp> means to
   test the <samp>SynchronizedState</samp>
   implementation; <samp>8</samp> means to divide the work into 8
   threads of roughly equal size; <samp>100000000</samp> means to do
   100 million swap transitions total; and <samp>5</samp>
   says to use a state array of 5 entries.
   The output of this command should look something like this:
<pre><samp>Total time 4.71665 s real, 5.14257 s CPU
Average swap time 377.332 ns real, 51.4257 ns CPU

real	0m4.843s
user	0m5.248s
sys	0m0.060s</samp></pre>
   The output says that from Java’s point of view the entire test took
   4.71665 s in real time and 5.14257 s of CPU time (the latter
   can be greater than the former in multithreaded programs).
   It also says that a single swap by a single thread took an average of
   377.332 ns of real time and 51.4257 ns of CPU time
   (the former should always be greater than the latter).
   From the Linux kernel’s point of view, the entire Java program
   consumed 4.843 s real time, 5.248 s user CPU time, and 0.060 s system
   CPU time.

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Build and use a sequential-consistency-violating
performance and reliability testing program,
along the lines described below.</p>

<ul>

 <li>Your program should operate under Java 13 or later. There
   is no need to run on older Java versions.</li>

 <li>Your program should compile cleanly, without any warnings,
   simply by using the shell command '<samp>javac *.java</samp>'.</li>

 <li>Please keep your implementation as simple and
   short as possible, for the benefit of the reader.</li>

 <li>Use two of the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers
   <samp>lnxsrv0[679]</samp> and <samp>lnxsrv10</samp>,
   with Java version 13.0.2, to do your performance and reliability
   measurements. On SEASnet if your <samp>PATH</samp> starts with
   "<samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp>:" you will run with version 13.0.2.
   Choose two servers with differing types of CPUs (look for "model name"
   in <samp>/proc/cpuinfo</samp>).</li>

 <li>Do not use more than 40 threads at a time,
   to avoid overloading the servers.</li>

 <li>Gather and report statistics about your two testing platforms, so that
   others can reproduce your results if they have similar
   hardware. See the output of <samp>java -version</samp>,
   and see the files <samp>/proc/cpuinfo</samp>
   and <samp>/proc/meminfo</samp>.</li>

 <li>Run the test harness on the <samp>Null</samp>
   and <samp>Synchronized</samp> classes, on each of the two servers you chose,
   along with various values for the size of the state array
   (use 5, 100, and at least one other value),
   the number of threads (use 1, 8, 40 and at least one other value)
   and roughly characterize
   the performance of the two classes.
   Use enough swap transitions so that your results are dominated by
   the actual work instead of by startup overhead.
   <samp>Null</samp> and <samp>Synchronized</samp> should have 100%
   reliability, in the sense that they should pass all the tests
   (even though the <samp>Null</samp> class does not work); check this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do the following tasks and submit work that embodies your results.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Implement a new class <samp>UnsynchronizedState</samp>, which is
   implemented just like <samp>SynchronizedState</samp> except that it
   does not use the keyword <samp>synchronized</samp> in its
   implementation. Put the implementation into a new file
   <samp>UnsynchronizedState.java</samp>.</li>

 <li>Design and implement a new class <samp>AcmeSafeState</samp> of
   that is safe without using the <samp>synchronized</samp> keyword.
   Your imlementation should use
   <samp><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicLongArray.html'>java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLongArray</a></samp>.
   The goal is to achieve better performance
   than <samp>SynchronizedState</samp> while retaining safety.
   Put the implementation into a new file
   <samp>AcmeSafeState.java</samp>.</li>

 <li>Integrate all the classes into a single program
   <samp>UnsafeMemory</samp>, which you should be able to compile
   with the command '<samp>javac *.java</samp>' and to run
   using the same sort of shell command as the test harness.
   Your version of <samp>UnsafeMemory.java</samp> will need
   to differ slightly from the one distributed as part of this assignment</li>

 <li>For each
   class <samp>SynchronizedState</samp>, <samp>UnsynchronizedState</samp>,
   and <samp>AcmeSafeState</samp>,
   measure and characterize the class's
   performance and reliability as described above (that is, use two
   servers, vary the state array size, and vary the number of threads).
   Attempt to find areas where these differ.</li>

 <li>Compare the classes' reliability and performance to each other.
   For each class, say what kind of benchmarks (if any) the class
   seems to do best and worst on.</li>
</ol>

<p>To help think about your <samp>AcmeSafeState</samp> implementation,
  read Doug
  Lea's <a href='http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/j9mm.html'>Using JDK
  9 Memory Order Nodes</a>, and you can look at the following
  packages and classes for other facts and ideas:</p>

8&frac12;"&times;11" page, as suggested in the USENIX template
mentioned in <a href='../comm.html'>Resources for written reports and
oral presentations</a>.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Characterize your <samp>AcmeSafeState</samp> implementation's basic idea
   using terminology taken from Lea's paper.
   In particular, explain whether and why
   your <samp>AcmeSafeState</samp> class is DRF.</li>
