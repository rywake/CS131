<h1>Homework 2. Naive parsing of context free grammars</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>You'd like to test grammars that are being proposed as test cases
for CS 132 projects. One way is to test it on actual CS 132 projects, but those
projects aren't done yet and anyway you'd like a second opinion in
case the student projects are incorrect. So you decide to write a
simple parser generator. Given a grammar in the style of
<a href='hw1.html'>Homework 1</a>,
your program will generate a function that is a parser. When this
parser is given a string whose prefix is a program to parse, it returns the
corresponding unmatched suffix, or an error indication if no prefix
of the string is a valid program.</p>

<p>The key notion of this assignment is that of a matcher. A
<dfn>matcher</dfn> is a function that inspects a given string of
terminals to
find a match for a prefix that corresponds to a nonterminal symbol of
a grammar, and then
checks whether the match is acceptable by testing whether a given
acceptor succeeds on the corresponding suffix.
For example, a matcher
for <samp>awkish_grammar</samp> below might inspect the
string <samp>["3";"+";"4";"-"]</samp> and find two possible
prefixes that match, namely <samp>["3";"+";"4"]</samp>
and <samp>["3"]</samp>. The matcher will first match
the prefix <samp>["3";"+";"4"]</samp>,
which corresponds to the suffix
<samp>["-"]</samp>. If this suffix is accepted, the matcher will return
whatever the acceptor returns. Otherwise, the matcher will match
the second prefix
<samp>["3"]</samp>, which corresponds to the suffix
<samp>["+";"4";"-"]</samp>, and will call the acceptor with that suffix
and return whatever the acceptor returns.
If a matcher finds no matching prefixes, it returns the special value
<samp>None</samp>.</p>

<p>As you can see by mentally executing the
example, matchers sometimes need to try multiple alternatives and to
backtrack to a later alternative if an earlier one is a blind
alley.</p>

<p>An <dfn>acceptor</dfn> is a function that accepts
a suffix by returning some value wrapped inside the <a
href='http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/core.html#hevea_manual17'><samp>Some</samp>
constructor</a>. The acceptor rejects the suffix by
returning <samp>None</samp>. For example, the acceptor <samp>(function
| "+"::t -&gt; Some ("+"::t) | _ -&gt; None)</samp> accepts only
suffixes beginning with <samp>"+"</samp>. Such an acceptor would cause
the example matcher to fail on the prefix <samp>["3";"+";"4"]</samp>
(since the corresponding suffix begins with <samp>"-"</samp>, not
<samp>"+"</samp>) but it would succeed on the prefix
<samp>["3"]</samp>.</p>

<p>By convention, an acceptor that is successful
returns <samp>Some s</samp>, where <samp>s</samp> is a tail of the input
suffix (because the acceptor may have parsed more of the input, and
has therefore consumed some of the suffix). This allows the matcher's caller to
retrieve an indication of where the matched prefix ends (since it ends
just before
the suffix starts). Although this behavior is crucial for the internal
acceptors used by your code, it is not required for top-level
acceptors supplied by test programs: a top-level acceptor needs only
to return a <samp>Some <var>x</var></samp> value to succeed.</p>

<p>Whenever there are several rules to try for a nonterminal,
you should always try them left-to-right. For example,
<samp>awkish_grammar</samp> below contains this:

<pre><samp>     | Expr -&gt;
         [[N Term; N Binop; N Expr];
          [N Term]]
</samp></pre>

<p>
and therefore, your matcher should attempt to use the rule "Expr
&rarr; Term Binop Expr" before attempting to use the simpler rule
"Expr &rarr; Term".
</p>

<p>If you can build a matcher, it should be relatively easy to build a
<dfn>parser</dfn>, which yields a parse tree that corresponds to its
input fragment.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<dl>

<dt><dfn>symbol</dfn>, <dfn>right hand side</dfn>, <dfn>rule</dfn></dt>
<dd>same as in Homework 1.</dd>

<dt><dfn>alternative list</dfn></dt> <dd>A list of right hand sides. It
corresponds to all of a grammar's rules for a given
nonterminal symbol. By convention, an empty alternative
list <samp>[]</samp> is treated as if it were a singleton
list <samp>[[]]</samp> containing the empty symbol string.</dd>

<dt><dfn>production function</dfn></dt> <dd>A function whose argument is a
nonterminal value. It returns a grammar's alternative list
for that nonterminal.</dd>

<dt><dfn>grammar</dfn></dt> <dd>A pair, consisting of a start symbol and a
production function. The start symbol is a nonterminal value.</dd>

<dt><dfn>fragment</dfn></dt> <dd>a list of terminal symbols, e.g., <samp>["3";
"+"; "4"; "xyzzy"]</samp>.</dd>

<dt><dfn>acceptor</dfn></dt> <dd>a function whose argument is
a fragment <var>frag</var>. If the
fragment is not acceptable, it
returns <samp>None</samp>; otherwise it returns <samp>Some
</samp><var>x</var> for some value <var>x</var>.</dd>

<dt><dfn>matcher</dfn></dt> <dd>a curried function with two arguments: an
acceptor <var>accept</var> and a fragment <var>frag</var>. A matcher matches a
prefix <var>p</var> of <var>frag</var> such that <var>accept</var>
(when passed the corresponding suffix) accepts the
corresponding suffix (i.e., the suffix of <var>frag</var> that remains
after <var>p</var> is removed). If there is such a match, the matcher
returns whatever
<var>accept</var> returns; otherwise it returns
<samp>None</samp>.</dd>

<dt><dfn>parse tree</dfn></dt> <dd>a data structure representing a parse
tree in the usual way. It has the following OCaml type:

<pre><samp>type ('nonterminal, 'terminal) parse_tree =
  | Node of 'nonterminal * ('nonterminal, 'terminal) parse_tree list
  | Leaf of 'terminal
</samp></pre>

If you traverse a parse tree in preorder left to right, the leaves you
encounter contain the same terminal symbols as the parsed fragment,
and each internal node of the parse tree corresponds to a rule in the
grammar, traversed in
a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leftmost_derivation#Derivations_and_syntax_trees'>leftmost
derivation</a> order.
</dd>

<dt><dfn>parser</dfn></dt> <dd>a function from fragments to parse trees.
Parsers consume the entire input, unlike matchers, which may consume only
an initial prefix of the input.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<ol>
<li>To warm up, notice that the format of grammars is different
in this assignment, versus Homework 1. Write a function
<samp>convert_grammar </samp><var>gram1</var><samp></samp> that
returns a Homework 2-style grammar, which is converted from the
Homework 1-style grammar <var>gram1</var>. Test your implementation
of <samp>convert_grammar</samp> on the test grammars given in Homework
1. For example, the top-level definition <samp>let awksub_grammar_2 =
convert_grammar awksub_grammar</samp> should
bind <samp>awksub_grammar_2</samp> to a Homework 2-style grammar that is
equivalent to the Homework 1-style
grammar <samp>awksub_grammar</samp>.</li>

<li>As another warmup, write a
function <samp>parse_tree_leaves <var>tree</var></samp> that traverses
the parse tree <samp><var>tree</var></samp> left to right and yields a
list of the leaves encountered.</li>

<li>Write a function <samp>make_matcher
</samp><var>gram</var><samp></samp> that returns a matcher for the
grammar <var>gram</var>. When applied to an acceptor <var>accept</var>
and a fragment <var>frag</var>, the matcher must try the grammar
rules in order and return the result
of calling <var>accept</var> on the suffix corresponding to the first
acceptable matching prefix of <var>frag</var>;
this is not necessarily the shortest or the longest
acceptable match. A match is considered to be acceptable if
<var>accept</var> succeeds when given the suffix
fragment that immediately follows the matching prefix. When this
happens, the matcher returns whatever the acceptor
returned. If no acceptable match is found, the matcher returns
<samp>None</samp>.</li>

<li>Write a function <samp>make_parser
</samp><var>gram</var><samp></samp> that returns a parser for the
grammar <var>gram</var>. When applied to
a fragment <var>frag</var>, the parser returns an optional parse
tree. If <var>frag</var> cannot be parsed entirely (that is, from
beginning to end), the parser returns <samp>None</samp>.
Otherwise, it returns <samp>Some <var>tree</var></samp>
where <samp><var>tree</var></samp> is the parse tree corresponding
to the input fragment. Your parser should try grammar rules in
the same order as <samp>make_matcher</samp>.</li>

<li>Write one good, nontrivial test case for your <samp>make_matcher</samp>
function. It should be in the style of the test
cases given below, but should cover different problem areas. Your test
case should be named <samp>make_matcher_test</samp>.
Your test case should test a
grammar of your own.</li>

<li>Similarly, write a good test case <samp>make_parser_test</samp> for
your <samp>make_parser</samp> function using your same test
grammar. This test should check that <samp>parse_tree_leaves</samp> is
in some sense the inverse of
<samp>make_parser <var>gram</var></samp>, in that
when <samp>make_parser <var>gram</var> <var>frag</var></samp>
returns <samp>Some <var>tree</var></samp>,
then <samp>parse_tree_leaves <var>tree</var></samp>
equals <samp><var>frag</var></samp>.</li>

<li>Assess your work by writing an after-action report that explains
why you decided to write <samp>make_parser</samp> in terms of
<samp>make_matcher</samp>, or vice versa, or neither;
and if it's "neither" then briefly explain the approach
that you took to avoid duplication in the two functions.
Also, explain any
weaknesses in your solution in the context of its intended
application. If possible, illustrate weaknesses by test cases that fail
with your implementation.
This report should be a simple <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII'>ASCII</a> <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text'>plain text</a> file
that
consumes a page or so (at most 100 lines and 80 columns per line,
and at least 50 lines,
please). See <a href='../comm.html'>Resources for oral presentations
and written reports</a> for advice on how to write assessments;
admittedly much of the advice there is overkill for the simple kind of
report we're looking for here.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unlike Homework 1, we are expecting some weaknesses here, so your
assessment should talk about them. For example, we don't expect that
your implementation will work with all possible grammars, but we would
like to know which sort of grammars it will have trouble with.</p>

<p>As with Homework 1, your code may use
the <a href='http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Stdlib.html'><samp>Stdlib</samp></a>
and <a href='http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html'><samp>List</samp></a>
modules, but it should use no other modules. Your code should be free of <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29'>side
effects</a>. Simplicity
is more important than efficiency, but your code should avoid using
unnecessary time and space when it is easy to do so.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>We will test your program on the SEASnet Linux servers as before,
so make sure that
<samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp> is at the start of your path,
using the same technique as in Homework 1.</p>

<p>Submit three files:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>hw2.ml</samp>
should define <samp>convert_grammar</samp>, <samp>parse_tree_leaves</samp>,
<samp>make_matcher</samp> and <samp>make_parser</samp>
along with any auxiliary types
and functions needed to define <samp>make_matcher</samp>.</li>
<li><samp>hw2test.ml</samp> should contain your test cases along
with any auxiliaries need for them.</li>
<li><samp>hw2.txt</samp> should hold your assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hint</h2>

<p>You can use <a href='hw2-2006-4.html'>a previous
Homework 2</a> as a hint. It is a tough homework and is not the same
problem but there are some common ideas. Look for the sample solution
at the end.</p>
